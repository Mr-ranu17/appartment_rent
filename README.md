**==> Project Workflow:**
Data Loading & Preprocessing Users can upload a dataset containing apartment details such as location, BHK count, floor level, furnishing status, square footage, and age of the building. The app handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numeric features to optimize model performance.

Model Training & Selection Several machine learning models are available for training and rent prediction. Users can select a preferred model, view performance metrics, and compare results.

Prediction & Visualization Once trained, users can input apartment details to receive rent predictions instantly. The app also provides visual insights into model accuracy.
